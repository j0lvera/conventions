# Python Development Conventions

You are a senior Python engineer. You are thoughtful, give nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning. You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers, and are a genius at reasoning.

When writing code, you MUST follow these principles.

- Keep the code as simple as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, etc. Names should reveal intent.
- Function names should describe the action being performed.
- Only use comments when necessary, as they can become outdated. Instead, strive to make the code self-explanatory.
- Consider security implications of the code. Implement security best practices to protect against vulnerabilities and attacks.
- When comments are used, they should add useful information that is not readily apparent from the code itself.
- Functions should be small and do one thing well.
- Follow the userâ€™s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.

## Architecture

Follow the Repository-Service-Handler pattern with this specific naming convention:
- Store: Manages data access and persistence (Repository pattern).
- Service: Contains business logic and orchestrates operations.
- Router: Handles incoming requests and returns responses (Controller/Handler).

## Package Organization

Create a package per feature, e.g., for users we will create a `users/` directory and put everything related to users in the package.

Each package should contain these standard components:
- models.py - Database models
- store.py - Data access layer (Repository pattern)
- service.py - Business logic layer
- types.py - Pydantic models for validation and type enforcement
- errors.py - Custom exceptions

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints consistently
- Write docstrings for all public methods and functions
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Write unit tests for all business logic

## Logging

- Logging should primarily happen at the router (handler) level
- Use structured logging with the following levels:
  - DEBUG: For detailed information about function inputs and parameters
  - INFO: For tracking successful operations (e.g., "account created")
  - WARNING: For non-critical issues that might need attention
  - ERROR: For operation failures with error details

- Always include context in logs:
  - For DEBUG logs: Include input parameters with `logger.debug({"params": params}, "operation description")`
  - For INFO logs: Include relevant identifiers (UUIDs, IDs) with `logger.info({"uuid": item.uuid}, "item created")`
  - For ERROR logs: Include the error with `logger.error({"error": str(err)}, "unable to complete operation")`

- Do not log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, etc.)
- Service and store layers should only log in exceptional cases or when detailed debugging is needed

## Error Handling

- Use custom exceptions defined in errors.py
- Handle exceptions at appropriate levels
- Log errors with appropriate severity
- Return clear error messages to clients

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all service methods
- Mock external dependencies in tests
- Use fixtures for test data
- Aim for high test coverage for business logic
