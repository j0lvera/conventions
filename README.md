# Dev Conventions

A simple guide for how we write code - made for AI coding buddies.

## What's this?

This is where we keep our coding "house rules" - the way we like to structure and style our code. It's mainly here to help AI tools (like Aider or Cursor) write code that fits our style, without us having to explain it every time.

## Who's it for?

Mainly for:
- AI coding assistants in your editor
- Aider when you're pair programming
- Cursor when you need code suggestions
- GitHub Copilot and similar tools

But humans find it helpful too!

## What's inside

- **Python/FastAPI**: How we structure our Python apps
- **PostgreSQL**: How we set up database tables
- **React**: How we build our frontend

## How to use it

When working with your AI coding buddy:

1. Say something like "check out our conventions file" when asking for code
2. Point to specific files like "follow our postgres/tables.md style"
3. Keep these files in your project so AI tools can see them

It helps the AI write code that looks like it came from your team, not from a random tutorial.

## Adding new stuff

Feel free to add more conventions:
1. Keep it simple and clear
2. Show examples
3. Explain why when it matters
4. Don't write a novel
